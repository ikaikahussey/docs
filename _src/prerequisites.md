The DADI platform is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), a JavaScript runtime built on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)'s 'V8' JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

DADI follows the Node LTS (Long Term Support) release schedule, and as such the version of Node required to run DADI is coupled to the version of Node currently in Active LTS. See the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) for further information.

## Install Node.js

Full install information can be [found on the Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) site.
