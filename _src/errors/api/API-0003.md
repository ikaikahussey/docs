### Cache Path Missing

To flush the cache, a path that matches a collection resource must be specified in the request body:

```http
POST /api/flush HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{ "path": "/1.0/library/books" }
```

This command will flush all cache files that match the collection path specified.

A successful cache flush returns a HTTP 200 response:

```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "message": "Cache flush successful"
}
```

#### Flush all files

To flush all cache files, send `{ path: "*" }`
