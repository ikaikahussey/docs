# Redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS

If you're using SSL with standard ports then any HTTP traffic to your website will be redirected to the secure HTTPS address instead.

**For example**
https://www.example.com listening on port 443
http://www.example.com listening on port 80

A request to the address http://www.example.com will receive a HTTP 301 response, redirecting the request to https://www.example.com.

### Running on non-standard ports

HTTP to HTTPS via nginx or something similar

#### Configuration for SSL

```js
"server": {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 443,
  "protocol": "https",
  "sslPassphrase": "<your ssl passphrase here>",
  "sslPrivateKeyPath": "<your ssl private key path here>",
  "sslCertificatePath": "<your ssl certificate path here>"
}
```
